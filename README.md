# Workshop
All the work from the summer workshop.
In this workshop I have learnt basics of neural networks.
Also learnt how CNNs work and worked on MNIST, Res-NET etc.
Also hosted a classifier using gradio in huggingface [Hemanth-Sai/Classifier](url).
We have explored many questions that reveal the intricate details of the realm of deep learning.
